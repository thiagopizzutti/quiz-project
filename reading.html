            <h1>Here's what you need to know abouth Blockchain</h1>
            <p> A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. By design,
                a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is 'an open, distributed ledger that can
                record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way'. Blockchain
                is typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter -
                node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be
                altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the
                network majority.Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure
                by design and high fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a
                blockchain. Blockchain was invented by a person - or group of people - using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
                in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi
                Nakamoto is unknown. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to
                solve the double - spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The
                bitcoin design has inspired other applications, and blockchains that are readable by the public are
                widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains
                have been proposed for business use. Sources such as Computerworld called the marketing of such
                blockchains without a proper security model." </p>
