            <h1>Here's what you need to know abouth Blockchain</h1>
            <p> When many investors in the U.S. hear the word 'blockchain', they immediately think of cryptocurrencies,
                and with good reason. The impressive new technology provides the support necessary for the
                decentralized, anonymized tracking and transaction of digital currencies around the world. However, as
                many industries are discovering, blockchain technology also allows for many other uses and applications
                as well.From insurance and real estate to crowdfunding and data management, the potential applications
                of blockchain technology are numerous, and it's likely that there will be new ways of adapting this
                technology to the mainstream business world in the future as well. But one important use of blockchain
                technology may be outside the mainstream business world: Some of the world's most impoverished nations
                may benefit from the integration of blockchain technology in various ways. </p>
